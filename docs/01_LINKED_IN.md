If you haven't heard, the ralph-wiggum-loop is life-changing in agentic software development.

But if you're tired of the Sophie's Choice of living dangerously without permissions and tapping "dyfj" in each of four terminals every 237 seconds, I have your mental health solution to your LOST conundrum.

https://github.com/cognaterra/better-drinking-bird

OG Drinking bird hooks Claude Code and every time it stops, just re-sends the plan. Fine, but...boring for my taste.

So I give you: Better Drinking Bird.

The Energy? Homer Simpson's Drinking Bird toy tapping 'Y' while he takes the day off. Better Drinking Bird enlists the economy LLM to take the guesswork out of what Claude Code is about to do to your repository.

**What it blocks:**

- Unsafe Command Guardrails? Check
- `rm -rf /` - GTFO
- `git reset --hard` and `git push --force`? Blocked
- `--no-verify` CI bypass attempts? Miss me with that
- Branch switching that corrupts your worktrees? Nah
- `cat .env` and credential snooping? Hard no

**What it nudges:**

- "Should I proceed?" → Get back to work
- "This is complex, let me try something simpler" → Stick to the plan
- "We can skip those tests" → Do it right

**Also supports:**
- Cursor and GitHub Copilot (not just Claude Code)
- Pluggable LLM backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama local)
- Generic stdin/stdout mode for anything else

**What else?** I don't know. Edit the prompt and find out. Make Claude talk like a baby whenever it tries to do something stupid. Make it be verbally agressive vs comforting and see which gets better results. Make it write code with Turkish semicolons or whatever....Not my tokens, not my problem.
